## Further Reading
* [Kohl et. al., "A Hierarchical Probabilistic U-Net for Modeling Multi-Scale Ambiguities", arXiv 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13077) is the original paper from which I learned about this idea.
* [Bayer et. al., "Mind the Gap when Conditioning Amortised Inference in Sequential Latent-Variable Models", ICLR 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07046) shows what happens when you use insufficient conditioning for the VAE posterior.


#### Acknowledgements
I have the pleasure of working with and learning from Danilo J. Rezende who [invented VAEs]()--it's Danilo who first taught me about supervised VAEs and the insufficient conditioning problem.
