I'm Adam Kosiorek. I'm passionate about machine learning. Currently I'm working on my master thesis on [Arm Movement Prediction](http://brml.org/positions/master-thesis-arm-movement-prediction/) with [Patrick van der Smagt](http://brml.org/people/smagt/) at [TUM](http://www.tum.de/en). I'm interested in (deep) unsupervised and reinforcement learning and generative models.
