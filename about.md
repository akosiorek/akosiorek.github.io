Hi, I'm Adam. I'm passionate about machine learning, particularly generative modeling. I'm really into timeseries, attention and external memory. Currently I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Oxford, where I'm working with [Ingmar Posner](http://ori.ox.ac.uk/mrg_people/ingmar-posner/). Before I did my master thesis on [Arm Movement Prediction](http://brml.org/positions/master-thesis-arm-movement-prediction/) with [Patrick van der Smagt](http://brml.org/people/smagt/) at [TUM](http://www.tum.de/en).

In my free time I train gymnastics and read lots of books.
