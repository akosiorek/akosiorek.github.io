Long COVID is a bitch. I know, because I've been suffering from long COVID for a few months now.
Given the little media coverage LC receives, it is not surprising that very few people realize how bad it is or how prevalent it is. The fact is that, upon COVID infection, a triple-vaccinatied person has about [4% chance](https://twitter.com/cjmaddison/status/1578177811491475456) of contracting brain damage or becoming effectively disabled (bed bound for days on end) due to long COVID. An [estimated 2 million people](https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1577939683618742273) in the UK alone suffer from LC. This is very unsettling.

The risk is too great to be ignored; the disability too powerful to be suffered alone. This is why I decided to share my experiences. If I get the signal that it proves useful, I'll keep sharing.

My long COVID has been getting better, but due to COVID reinfection about 3 weeks ago I'm back in the gutter. It is improving, albeit very slowly and non-linearly. I try to stay optimistic. Below I share a description of a recent morning and some of my coping strategies. Hope this helps!

I wake up at 7 am feeling a little groggy, and hungry.
I start my day with a healthy breakfast[^breakfast].
I eat in front of a SAD lamp[^SAD]. It makes the grogginess go away and helps me sleep better at night. It really helps. At the end of breakfast, I'm not groggy anymore; I'm starting to feel quite good.

[^breakfast]: My breakfast consists of eggs and fruit. For eggs, I have 2 organic eggs sunny-side up fried on a tsp bacon served with a cup of steamed spinach with chili, turmeric, and salt, half a cup of black beans, and half a cup sauerkraut. For fruit, I have a bowl of blueberries with 100g fat-free greek yogurt, tbsp ground flaxseed, tsp cocoa powder, a shake of cinnamon, and a bit of turmeric. It may sound complicated, but using canned beans and frozen spinach, it takes just a few minutes to prep. I like my food to be yummy, nutritious, and healthy. This breakfast is a compromise between Tim Ferriss's "4 Hour Body" and Micheal Greger's "How Not to Die".

[^SAD]: Sunlight exposure just after waking up is recommended by top sleep scientists (Matthew Walker in his "Why we sleep" book, and Andrew Huberman in his podcasts). It makes you feel better during the day and improves sleep by regulating the circadian rythm. In the absence of sunlight (early morning wakeups, winter), they recommend using a [SAD lamp](https://www.healthline.com/health/sad-lamp) originally developed for treating [seasonal affective disorder](https://www.healthline.com/health/seasonal-affective-disorder).

It's 8 am.
It's going to be a great day.
I sit down to read with a cup of coffee.

20 min later I'm tired. I've just reread the last paragraph three times and I
still don't understand it. There is a low level of anxiety lurking in my belly.
I feel it as a little tight knot halfway between my navel and sternum.
I've also just started to be really thirsty.

Not to worry. I've been there a thousand times and I know what to do.
For thirst, I prepare water with electrolytes[^electrolytes].
For anxiety, I sit cross-legged: time to meditate.
20 min later the anxiety is gone. But I'm feeling profoundly tired.
Time to lie down.

[^electrolytes]: I use the [LMNT recipe](https://drinklmnt.com/blogs/health/the-best-homemade-electrolyte-drink-for-dehydration) with 1g sodium equivalent per 1l of water. Here's [a recipe for 200 portions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JeQcUnEv6Sz6PJnuP59c4cZ9iBqBr2AA_otpm1RkdvE/edit?usp=sharing).

I go to bed to do a 20 min [Sensate](https://www.getsensate.com) session. It's the best way I found to relax.
Lying down with my eyes closed provides a kind of sensory deprivation that turns out to be super useful for recovery from the long-COVID tiredness ([twitter study](https://twitter.com/organichemusic/status/1582318635460485122?t=feJK9kW5n8rz1duKvm5shQ&s=19); VGS is e.g. Sensate). Sensate provides vagus nerve stimulation[^VGS] that down-regulates the central nervous system and helps escape the near-constant, infection-induced fight-or-flight mode (extremely
tiring in itself).

[^VGS]: Sensate is expensive and time-consuming with a session lasting 10-20 min. There are cheaper devices out there that provide e.g. electrical stimulation to your inner ear, which takes only about a minute or two.

After 20 min I feel deeply relaxed but perhaps even more tired.
I've just finished my first 1l water+electrolyte portion.
I prepare another one, and then do another 20 min Sensate session.
After 40 min total of lying down with Sensate, I'm feeling somewhat less tired and ready to get up.

I get up, go to the living room, and sit down. I try to read but still can't focus.
Let's do another round of meditation.
20 min later I'm feeling good enough to stop resting. I'm feeling quite good, actually.

It's 10am. I decide to write this blog. It might be helpful to someone. It takes about
an hour. At the end, I downed another liter of electrolyte water. I'm still thirsty, so I make another one. The thirst will go away in another 2 or 3 liters.

I'm also surprised I'm not tired after writing this, though minor breathing difficulties have set in: it feels like there's a weight at the bottom of my ribcage that I need to push out with every breath.
If things go well I might go out for a walk today, maybe even see a friend.
I'll probably do another 20 min meditation, 20 min breathing exercises, and at least 20 min
Sensate, just to get through the day.

It's been a great day so far.

I consider the above morning to be quite good. Yes, I needed a lot of rest, but I managed to stay motivated and take care of myself. Some mornings resting does not help and all I have energy for is listening to an audiobook for the remainder of the day. Other times, I may not be in a good enough place mentally to even engage in self-care practices. When this happens I tend to watch Netflix, which in itself is quite tiring for me (as is visual processing and social engagement). Unfortunately, long COVID comes with a slew of mental health issues. Sometimes it is really challenging, but I try to stay optimistic.
