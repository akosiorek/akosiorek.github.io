# ML Research Job Hunt

I am about to finish my PhD, and I have just signed a job contract, after about four months of sending applications, interviewing and negotiating.
Even though I tried to remain active in my research and fulfil my other PhD obligations (writing the thesis, say), I had to essentially take a break.
Yes, a job hunt is a full-time activity; it not only takes a lot of time but is intense and can be very stressful.
Now that I am back to writing my thesis, many people asked me to share my job hunt experience, and it's an excellent opportunity to procrastinate!

Before starting my job hunt I extensively talked to fellow PhD students and new starters at DeepMind, Brain, and FAIR to find out about their interview and negotiation experience, and to learn about compensation landscapes at these places.
I applied to quite a few companies, some of which were not interested (e.g. FAIR and Netflix--both said I am too junior) and some that did not get back to me at all (Baidu, Alibaba). In the end, I interviewed with Adobe, Apple, CuriousAI, DeepMind (internship), Google Brain (internship + full-time conversion), Google Health, Graphcore, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Twitter.
Finally, I decided to take the Research Scientist role at DeepMind, where I will be working with [Danilo Rezende](https://danilorezende.com/about/).

In the following, I am trying to distil what I learned, and I describe my own experiences.
I expect that many job hunts might look similar, but it will all depend on your circumstances. Please take whatever I write with a grain of salt.

# What's Your Worth?
The majority of the PhD students I know either did not put any effort into the job hunt and accepted the first offer they got, or did interview at a few companies but then took the initial offer from the company they liked the most.

At first glance, there is nothing wrong with it.
You love machine learning, you're excited to start working on it again, and with initial offers being several times higher than a typical PhD stipend, you think that you should just accept it and start working.
What you need to remember, though, is that the primary goal of any company out there is making money, and the job of a recruiter is to sign you at the lowest compensation possible.
ML research staff is exceptionally scarce, however, and in very high demand.
Big tech companies desperately need you, and you are very likely to be able to get much more than any initial offer might indicate.

My theory is that any offer you have lower-bounds your market value.
If several companies want to hire you, they will want to outbid each other, which leads to tightening the gap between your offers and your real value.
Eventually, your offers converge on the market value, at which point the companies you talk to stop increasing their offers.
Tightening the bound requires some preparation and skill, both in securing offers from other companies as well as negotiation.

# Before You Begin
The first questions you should ask yourself before applying for jobs is what it is that you want to do, and what are the things that you care about (people, type of work, growth ability, location, compensation, etc.).
This should allow you to short-list a few companies that you could see yourself working at.
Once you have that list, try to come up with at least a couple of related ones.
Even if you are not interested in working for them, interviewing there will provide the necessary preparation for the interviews at your target companies.

Once you start applying, everything might progress very quickly, but this depends on the candidate, and the variance can be rather high.
I thought that it might take about three months from applications to interviews, but in my case it took only about two weeks, and on-sites followed two weeks after that.
Once you start getting offers, negotiation can take anywhere from two to six weeks.
The entire process is quite stressful, so I would suggest limiting any responsibilities within that time and just focus on the job search.

Since it might take only about two weeks from applications to your first interviews, you might want to start preparing for interviews way ahead of applying.
You will need to prepare for:
  * coding interviews - similar to software engineering jobs, but in my case, these were less complicated with a strong focus on ML,
  * a job talk - 45 min + Q&A, but it's a good idea to have a shorter version handy, as things tend to get delayed,
  * an answer for "why you want to work here?" - I got asked this question everywhere I interviewed at, sometimes by multiple interviewers
  * some companies might require recommendation letters - for me Adobe was the only one that required them

# How to Apply
The most straightforward (and often most practical choice) is to just apply via the company website (I did that, e.g. for Adobe and Twitter).
It should go without saying, however, that it is better to be recommended for the job.
This can be either internally, by someone within the company that knows you (that helped me to get interviews with Brain and DeepMind), or externally.
An excellent way to get an external recommendation is to ask your mentor or a collaborator to write a recommendation letter and send it directly to a high-ranking scientist or manger at the target company (that's what I did with Apple and OpenAI).

# A Typical Interview Process
After you apply, you will be contacted by a recruiter.
Their job is to:
  * figure out what your goals are and if you are a good fit for the company or the team they are hiring for,
  * keep in touch with you to see where you stand concerning other companies,
  * keep a tab on your timeline,
  * schedule interviews,
  * answer any questions about the process or the company you might have,
  * get you to sign the offer should you get one.

The recruiter will often perform an initial screen to see if you are a serious candidate and then schedule your first interview.
In my case, the first interview was typically just a chat about my research interests and what I would like to work on, with only a few technical questions.
I think Salesforce was the only company that asked me to write code in this initial screening phase.

If you manage to get past the screening phase, you will be invited for an on-site interview.
An on-site can last anywhere between four (Twitter) and 10 (Adobe) hours, and usually consists of:
  * one or more coding interviews,
  * several research interviews,
  * a job talk,
  * a soft-skills interview with higher management and/or HR.

Each interview is typically between 30 and 45 min long, and interviews are often back to back.
Typically, you will be offered a washroom break in between interviews.
I took it every single time, even if only to wash my face and spend a minute alone.
Trust me--it goes a long way in a day of ten back-to-back interviews!

When you schedule your on-sites, it is a good idea never to schedule them on consecutive days.
I would go a step further and suggest scheduling no more than one on-site per week, even if it drags your timeline out.
If you are travelling across many time-zones, it might be a good idea to arrive a few days in advance to adjust to the local time zone.

After the on-site, you will hear back from your recruiter within two to ten working days, hopefully with good news.
If you do not hear back from them after four days, it might be a good idea to reach out and ask what is taking so long.
Getting the actual numbers might require another week or two of waiting, though.

As a side note, I like following up with the recruiters after every single interview.
Typically, I would just email them straight after the interview and share my impressions, for example:
  > Hi XXX, we've just finished the interview with YYY. It was quite exciting, and I got this cool question about...

  or

  > Hi XXX, we've just finished the interview. I think it didn't go that well, as I forgot (some detail)...

Getting feedback of this kind is helpful for the recruiter, as it allows them to better calibrate the interview feedback.
Once, when I thought that the interviewer was disinterested and inappropriate, I also shared this feedback.
The recruiter went out of their way to understand what happened and explain the confusion, and I still ended up getting the offer!



# Negotiations
Once you start accumulating offers, everything will proceed very quickly.
The recruiters are on your side: once you pass the interviews, the recruiter's top priority is to sign you.
They are happy to fight for increasing your compensation package, but it is your job to convince them of your worth.
For this reason, it literally *pays* to be in good relations with your recruiter;
it is also a good idea to exchange at least one email or a phone call with every recruiter every week--just to make sure they feel kept in the loop.

Generally, your offers will have no deadlines on them.
If a recruiter tells you that they are going to make you an offer, and you are only beginning the process with another company, just tell your recruiter about it.
In my case, I just told all my recruiters when I was expecting to have all my offers.
This did delay getting the actual numbers from most of the companies, but it did make negotiations easier.
No recruiter in their right mind will rescind your offer only because you failed to make a decision until the end of the week, even if they say otherwise.
The only exception here is when they give you a short deadline (typically 24 hours) after several rounds of back-and-forth--this is to make sure that you do not use the increased offer to improve your counters yet another time.

Once you have numbers from all the companies, you can start negotiating.
People often say that you should negotiate only with the companies that you might end up working for, hereafter referred to as *alpha* companies, but I disagree.
To increase your compensation, you need good counteroffers, as no company will go much higher than your highest counteroffer.
However, before you start, you do not really know how much any company wants you.
Even if you do not want to work at a given company (*beta*), it might be worth it to see how much you can get from them, since it might be useful as a counteroffer.

Negotiating with the beta companies also gives you practice before engaging with the alphas.
In my process, I negotiated with betas and got them as high as they could go before talking to alphas.
This allowed me to minimize the number of back-and-forths with the alphas.
I think it was helpful since recruiters can get annoyed if you try to do too many roundtrips.

# Good Luck!
I hope the above gives you a helpful overview of how a job hunt looks like and how much effort it takes.
Planning and preparation are key, but the rest is up to you.
If you do it right, you mind end up getting more than twice what your initial offers indicated. I do not care about money, but it does open up possibilities, so why not take it?

A few books I can recommend on negotiation and communication, which are useful for the job hunt but more importantly also for everyday life:
