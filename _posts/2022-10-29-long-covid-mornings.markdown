I wake up at 7 am feeling a little groggy, and hungry.
Let's make some breakfast[^breakfast].
I eat in front of a SAD lamp. It makes the grogginess go away and helps me
sleep better at night.
It really helps. At the end of breakfast I'm feeling great.

[^breakfast]: a cup of steamed spinach with chilli, turmeric and salt, half cup black beans, half cup sauerkraut, 2 organic eggs sunny-side up fried on a tsp bacon plus a bowl of blueberries with 100g fat-free greek yoghurt, tbsp ground flaxseed, tsp cocoa powder, a shake of cinnamon and a bit of turmeric. I like my food to be yummy, nutritious, and healthy. This breakfast is a compromise between Tim Ferriss's "4 Hour Body" and Micheal Greger's "How Not to Die".

It's 8 am.
It's going to be a great day.
I sit down to read with a cup of coffee.

20 min later I'm tired. I've just reread the last paragraph three times and I
still don't understand it. There is a low level of anxiety lurking in my belly.
I feel it as a little tight knot halfway between my navel and sternum.
I've also just started to be really thirsty.

Not to worry. I've been there a thousand times and I know what to do.
For thirst, I prepare water with electrolytes[^electrolytes].
For anxiety, I sit cross-legged: time to meditate.
20 min later the anxiety is gone. But I'm feeling profoundly tired.
Time to lie down.

I go to bed to do a 20 min [Sensate](https://www.getsensate.com) session. It's the best way I found to relax.
Lying down with my eyes closed provides a kind of sensory deprivation that proves
essential for recovery from the long-COVID tiredness ([twitter study](https://twitter.com/organichemusic/status/1582318635460485122?t=feJK9kW5n8rz1duKvm5shQ&s=19); VGS is e.g. Sensate). Sensate provides vagus
nerve stimulation that down-regulates the central nervous system and helps escape the near-constant, infection-induced fight-or-flight mode (extremely
tiring in itself).

[^electrolytes]: I use the [LMNT recipe](https://drinklmnt.com/blogs/health/the-best-homemade-electrolyte-drink-for-dehydration) with 1g sodium equivalent per 1l of water. Here's a recipe for 200 portions: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JeQcUnEv6Sz6PJnuP59c4cZ9iBqBr2AA_otpm1RkdvE/edit?usp=sharing).

After 20 min I feel deeply relaxed, but perhaps even more tired.
I've just finished my first 1l water+electrolyte portion.
I prepare another one, and then do another 20 min Sensate session.
After 40 min total of lying down with Sensate I'm feeling somewhat less tired and ready to get up.

I get up, go to the living room, sit down. I try to read but still can't focus.
Let's do another round of meditation.
20 min later I'm feeling good enough to stop resting. I'm feeling quite good, actually.

It's 10am. Let's write this blog. It might be helpful to someone. It takes about
an hour. At the end, I downed another litre of electrolyte water. I'm still thirsty, so I make another one. The thirst will go away in another 2 or 3 litres.

I'm also surprising I'm not tired, though minor breathing difficulties have set in: it feels like there's a weight at the bottom of my ribcage that I need to push out with every breath.
If things go well I might go out for a walk today, maybe even see a friend.
I'll probably do another 20 min meditation, 20 min breathing exercises, and at least 20 min
Sensate, just to get through the day.

It's a great day so far.
